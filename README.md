# Hw3_password_generator

For the third bootcamp homework assignment each student was given base code and meant to expand upon the Javascript to create a password generator.

In this assignment it was key to create/use arrays, prompts, and for loops while gathering user input and utilize said input for generating a password using the desired user criteria.
